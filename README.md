The application for shopping app

## Getting Started

1.  **Ensure Flutter is Installed**: Make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed and configured on your machine. You can check this by running `flutter --version` in your terminal. If Flutter is not installed, follow the official Flutter installation guide: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

2.  **Connect a Device or Start an Emulator**: Connect a physical Android or iOS device to your computer, or start an Android emulator or iOS simulator.

3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of Flutter project.

4.  **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

    ```
    flutter pub get
    ```

5.  **Run the App**: Execute the following command to run the app on your connected device or emulator:

    ```
    flutter run
    ```

    This command will build the app and install it on your device or emulator. You should then see the app running.

6.  **(Optional) Specify a Target Device**: If you have multiple devices connected, you can specify the target device using the `-d` flag:

    ```
    flutter run -d <device_id>
    ```

    To see a list of connected devices and their IDs, run:

    ```
    flutter devices
    ```
